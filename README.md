Web Application Final Project
=============================

My final project for my Website Developement course at SAIT

This project focuses on functionality of a Home Inventory System. There is little to no styling, hence why there is no CSS file.
The main objective of this project was to create a complex inventory system useing Java servlets and SQL. Allowing users to create accounts to keep track of various supplies within their home. The database consists of multiple categories for all different types of household products. Each item had a specified category relating to the location the item would be located within the home.
